When initialized with a container DOM element, the View adds a Canvas or SVG-based visualization to a web page. Alternatively, a View can be used either client-side or server-side to export static SVG or PNG (Canvas) images.\n\nFor the API reference, see the [Vega View API documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/).\n",
